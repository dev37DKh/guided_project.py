# Heavy Traffic Indicators Analysis on I-94

## Overview
This project aims to analyze factors contributing to heavy congestion on the I-94 highway, particularly focusing on westbound traffic. The analysis examines various indicators, such as time of day, day of the week, and weather conditions, to identify their impact on traffic volume.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from [Metro Interstate Traffic Volume](https://data.gov/) and contains hourly traffic volume data along with corresponding weather conditions.

## Analysis Steps
1. Load and inspect the dataset.
2. Analyze the distribution of traffic volume.
3. Segment data into daytime and nighttime traffic.
4. Examine traffic volume by month, day of the week, and hour.
5. Explore the correlation between weather conditions and traffic volume.
6. Visualize findings through various plots.

## Conclusion
The analysis identifies significant patterns related to time and weather conditions affecting traffic volume. Recommendations for future work include implementing predictive modeling techniques using machine learning to forecast traffic congestion.
