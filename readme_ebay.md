# Used Car Listings Analysis on eBay Kleinanzeigen

## Project Overview
This project aims to clean, analyze, and extract insights from a dataset of used car listings obtained from eBay Kleinanzeigen, the German eBay site. We explore the relationships between various car attributes such as price, mileage, and brand, and develop a linear regression model to predict car prices based on these features.

## Contents
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of key metrics (e.g., price distribution, mileage)
- Analysis of average prices and mileages by brand
- Correlation analysis between price and mileage
- Machine learning model to predict car prices

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is in CSV format and contains various attributes of used cars, including:
- Price
- Odometer reading
- Brand
- Registration year
- Fuel type
- Gearbox type

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. Place the autos.csv dataset in the project directory.
